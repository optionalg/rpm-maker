To package a simple tarball into an RPM, the following steps will help you get started.

1) Run vagrant up
This will download the necessary dependencies to create the rpm

2) Log into the VM and run "rpmdev-setuptree".  This will setup the basic folder structure needed to create the RPM under ~/rpmbuild (BUILD, BUILDROOT, SPECS, SOURCES, RPM, SRPM).

3) Copy your tarball into the SOURCES folder

4) Create a spec file in the SPECS folder.  You can use the included jenkins-plugins.spec as a starting point.

5) cd into the SPECS folder and run "rpmbuild -ba jenkins-plugins.spec".  This tells rpmbuild to build all the steps in your spec file and will create the rpm in the ~/rpmbuild/RPMS folder.

6) To install the rpm on a test machine
rpm -ivh jenkins-plugins-1-1.fc18.x86_64.rpm

7) To remove an installed rpm on a test machine
rpm -e jenkins-plugins-1-1.fc18.x86_64
